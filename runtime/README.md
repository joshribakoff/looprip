# Agent Pipeline Runtime

TypeScript runtime for executing agentic pipeline YAML configurations.

## Install (dev)

```bash
cd runtime
npm install
npm run build
```

## CLI usage

After linking the root package (`npm run install:cli`):

```bash
p run path/to/pipeline.yaml --prompt "Your request here"
p validate path/to/pipeline.yaml
```

Interactive mode (default in TTY when no subcommand is given):

```bash
p
# or explicitly
p interactive
```

Interactive mode now stays open in a loop until you press Ctrl+C:

- After each run, you're brought back to the pipeline picker.
- Your last selection is preselected, so you can just press Enter to rerun it repeatedly.
- If the pipeline requires a prompt, your last prompt text will be prefilled.
- Press Ctrl+C at any time to exit.

### Create a prompt fast

Scaffold a Markdown prompt file (defaults to `prompts/`) and open it in VS Code:

```bash
p prompt create "my-new-idea" --open
# creates prompts/my-new-idea.md

p prompt create prompts/research/outline.md --open
# creates nested folders as needed
```

Tip: In interactive mode, pick "Create new promptâ€¦" to get an inline path input prefilled with `prompts/new-prompt.md`.

## Develop

```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
npm test
```

Env:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or pass `--api-key`)
