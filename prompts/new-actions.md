The agent should have access to some additional tools. 

- Listing directories, with optional recursive glob patterns
- Running specific NPM scripts -- maybe there is some kind of mapping where the model can choose which npm script to run from a list of allowed scripts and it can set specific variables for the command line flags, but it can't just create arbitrary bash commands.
