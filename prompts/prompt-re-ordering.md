Ideally, the prompts should be numbered by order of priority or something like that, and then you should be able to use the UI to move them around.

Like, hit Enter, and then press the up and down arrow, and then hit Enter when you're done moving. It will rename all of the files to re-order them accordingly.

Eg 01-hello.md 02-world.md
