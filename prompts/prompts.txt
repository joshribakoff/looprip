I'm adding a lot of prompts text files to the root of this repository, and it's getting out of hand. I think we could create a folder for organizing the prompts and start structuring them a little bit better. 

And we could leverage the interactive command line to be able to select a prompt to assign it to a workspace or whatever. 

The system could then be set up via the pipelines to clean up the prompt file when it's done or toggle status in a front matter. 

To start with, we can move all the existing prompts into a prompt folder and structure them with an example front matter structure. 

And then you could literally output additional prompts in there for implementing the additional features, like adding the prompting related features to the interactive command line mode.
