It still lets me press enter when it's invalid, but it should not do that.

So I don't want to have to have a separate confirmation page that I have to press Enter on to return to the main menu. I'd like to just return to the main menu with some sort of status area where it gives you the confirmation.

Also the part where I am typing should just be the ID. with no path or file extension. It can continue to show the interpolated full path below. If I use spaces or punctuation, it should automatically normalize it to lower case with hyphens.
