Installed it, the output is weird. There's like an overly escaped new line. And then a check mark that doesn't look that good. Like there's a lack of separation and an opportunity to use better color coding and emojis here. And then it tells me to run `p --help`, or a weird long command. Like it should just be telling me to run `p` with no arguments, which is like the main interactive loop that we want to be the default that people use. We can still keep the other examples, but the first should be just "p".
