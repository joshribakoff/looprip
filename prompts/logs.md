It's pretty annoying having to scroll through the logs inside of the TUI. 

Ideally, we should be appending logs to files or folders adjacent to the prompts so that we can easily review them inside of the native editor. 

We can still display the logs inside of the T-UI, but it should also auto-scroll to the bottom as the logs run. 

There should be a button to toggle auto-following. 

And then I should show the full path to the log file so the person can Apple-click on it to open the log file externally.
