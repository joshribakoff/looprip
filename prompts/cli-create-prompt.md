When I run the CLI, I want to be able to create a prompt. One of the options available to me should be "Create new prompt." Then I type the file name minus the.md extension, and it automatically creates that file. Bonus points if there is some way to pop it open in VS Code or print the name so that I can control-click the file and open it. 

It shouldn't make me type anything too lengthy in the command line. It should just pretty much scaffold out the file so I can open it and type inside the file using my editor.
