When I run a pipeline in interactive mode, it exits, but I want it to stay in a loop until I hit Ctrl+C. Like, keep allowing me to run pipelines. Just immediately let me select another pipeline to run with the previous one already preselected, so that if I hold down Enter, it keeps running the same pipeline in a loop.
