The interactive mode isn't really documented, I think maybe that should be like the default. Unless the CI environment variable is set, then it defaults to non-interactive. 


When I ran the command, it first asked me what I want to do and I had to select "Run a pipeline." But that should just be the main mode, like the main reason we would ever run this command is to run the pipeline. 

✗ npx tsx src/cli/index.js interactive
✔ What do you want to do? › Run a pipeline

✔ Select a pipeline file › examples/run-unit-tests/pipeline.yaml

At this point, I had selected the pipeline. I don't want any more questions; I should just run it. There could be hidden key linings for verbose output or something, but honestly, we should just remove that for now. We don't need special verbose output for now. Or any kind of optional user prompt, assuming that that is some kind of hard-coded system-level thing. Unless the pipeline takes in variables, it should not ask any more questions. 

✔ Verbose output? … no / yes
✔ Optional user prompt for agent nodes (press Enter to skip) …
